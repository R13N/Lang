Resources
---------

This file states how resoures are available as constants within the repo.

Say you have a language file which localizes some strings to Dutch. You don't want to access these from withing an IO-monad each time.
That's why you do it here!

-- will be available as Resources.localize : String -> String
-- IO is read only in this file!
localize : String -> IO String
term	= do	locale	<- getLocale
		readFile "locales/"+locale
		return $ lookup term
