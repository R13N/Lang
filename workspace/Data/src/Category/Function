An associative function is a function for which you can swap the arguments, and get the same function.
---
cat Associative a	in a -> a -> a
	> f:Associative a, a,b,c:a => f a (f b c) = f (f a b) c

---
A commutative function
---
cat Commutative a	in a -> a -> a
	> f:Commutative a, a,b:a => f a b = f b a
