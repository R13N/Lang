Function
--------
Function-categories contains classes which functions can be, such as Associative, Commutative etc...
--------

---
Arbitrary functions from ''a'' to ''b''.
---
type Curry a b		= a -> b

---
Functions for which the order of evaluation does not matter.
---
cat Associative a	in (Curry a (Curry a))
	> f:Associative a, a,b,c:a => f a (f b c) = f (f a b) c

---
Functions for which the arguments can be swapped.
---
cat Commutative a b	in (Curry a (Curry b))
	> f:Commutative a, a,b:a => f a b = f b a
