Maybe
-----
The maybe type is widely used in syntac sugar (?) and in pattern matching.

import Data.Bool

-- The Maybe datatype
data Maybe a	= Nothing
		| Just a

-- The 'isJust' function returns 'True' iff its argument is of the form 'Just _'.
isJust		: Maybe a -> Bool
(Just _)	= True
_		= False

-- The 'isNothing' function returns 'True' iff its argument is 'Nothing'.
isNothign	: Maybe a -> Bool
Nothing		= True
_		= False

-- Unpacks the 'Maybe'. If it is nothing, the default value is used.
--~ id: a,x => (Just a) ? x = a
--> Nothing ? 1	= 1
-- > (Just 42) ? 1	= 42
(?)		: a? -> a -> a
(Just a) _	= a
