---
A ''Collection'' which preserves order and allows duplicate elements.

The syntactic sugar ''[a]'' desugars to ''List a''

---
-- TODO  in Collection a
cat List a
	-- Returns the first element of the list. The element returned is of the type 'a', but might be a subclass of element 'a' too.
	head	: [a] -> (b:a)
	-- Returns the given list without the first element. The returned elements might be a subtype of the given list.
	tail	: [a] -> [(b:a)]
	empty	: Maybe ()
