PARSER
======

This module contains the actual data structure representing the languate language, alongside with the parser + its bnf files.

Overview
========


bnf
---

In bnf, there are bnf-files defining the syntax of the language. To test these files, open ````Test.hs```` in interactive mode, and run the function ````t "ruleToTest" "string to parse"````

Bugs and comments are welcome in the bug tracker (both about the syntax and the bnf lib)!

Def

Code will come there


workspace
---------

An example workspace with languate code. Acts as a example/regression test/tryout...

The subfiles in there (will) represent modules.

Feel free to add your own! (Once the code works :p)
