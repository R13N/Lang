Basic markdown, with these exceptions

- Code fences: backtick, single qoute, double qoute (from each at least two). This is because a backtick is annoying to type on azerty

- Extra explanation (not really footnotes, but more popup boxes): (((extra explanation))). Also in code, as three equally bracketed parentheses should never occur (or are easily detected by a tool as markdown)
